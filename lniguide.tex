\section{Motivation}

Students in programming clubs like CoderDojos\footnote{\url{https://coderdojo.com}} use special software to write computer programs.
To keep the entrance barrier low, these clubs do not charge for attendance.
As a result, the computers use Linux, preferably on USB-devices.
An installation of Ubuntu on a USB-device boots slowly or not, see Section~\ref{sec:related}.
Therefore, we created a tool to create files which extend the live system on the  USB-device, so called addons.
They can be installed by copying them onto the stick.
They may contain software, files and configuration.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

There are several ways customize a Ubuntu on a USB-device.
In the following, we discuss the installation on the USB-device, creating custom ISO images, extending the squashfs.filesystem, and using the persistence of the live system.

\subsection{The Released Live Images}

We used the Live images in a programming club "CoderDojo" at the 33C3\footnote{\url{https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Projects:Junghackertag}}.
They booted in below five minutes.
However, additional software needed to be installed on every system by hand, every time the system  was rebooted.
This is in contrast to the mindless automate all the things approach we are used to.

\subsection{Installation of Ubuntu on a USB device}

Ubuntu can be installed on a USB device.
This seems to be the natural way since the live CD suggest installing it.
We performed such an installation on a USB 2.0 device with 5MB/s writing and 10mb/s reading speed.
Lubuntu 16.4\footnote{\url{http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/xenial/}} did not boot to desktop. 
Ubuntu Mate 16.4\footnote{\url{https://ubuntu-mate.org}} took 5 minutes to boot.
Then, it was unresponsive with every click we made, was it opening the main menu or opening Firefox.

We concluded, that an installation on these USB devices was too slow and frustrating to use.

\subsection{Creating Custom ISO Images}
\label{sec:custom}

Since CoderDojo Potsdam\footnote{\url{http://coderdojopotsdam.github.io/}} is not the only Dojo using USB devices to boot a custom image from, we decided to create a software which should make it possible to extend live-images to any needs.
We created CodersOS\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CodersOS/}} for the following work flow:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose the software from a website\footnote{\url{https://codersos.github.io/create}}
  \item Build the image\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CodersOS/image-creator-server}}
  \item Download and flash the ISO file to the USB device.
\end{enumerate}

Despite implementing the process fully, some ISO images did not boot because the 
squashed file system could not be mounted.
It can be assumed that some Ubuntu flavors can boot this way but looking at Ubuntu Remix, Xubuntu and Meilix, we did not find a reliable way to boot them.

\subsection{Live Image Persistence}
\label{sec:pers}

When an Ubuntu live ISO boots, one can pass parameters such as \texttt{PERSISTENCE}.
Given this parameter, the live image looks for the file \texttt{casper-rw} with an ext2 file system in it.
This file system is mounted in read-write mode\footnote{To find this behavior, unzip the file \texttt{casper/initrd.lz} and have a look at the casper shell script or preferably \url{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence}} on an AUFS layer above the filesystem.squashfs.
Any change of the file system is saved to this file.

When using this method, the system ``Ubuntu 16.10 Destop amd64" did not boot after installing software.
This is not as reliable as we hoped.

\subsection{Ubuntu Customization Kit}

There is a variety of customization programs for Ubuntu distributions.
We had a look at the Ubuntu Customization Kit "UCK"\footnote{\url{http://uck.sourceforge.net/}}.
The project is discontinued, so we decided against using this as a basis for the  image customization.


\subsection{Customizer}

Customizer\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kamilion/customizer}} is a software to change existing ISO images.
This software features a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
Both can be used.
We wanted to create an automated customization over a website, see Section~\cite{sec:custom}.
We could not understand the CLI at this time.
Thus, we discarded the tool.
Furthermore, this tool uses the change-root environment, which is not available in docker.
Having gathered the knowledge of Section~\ref{sec:live}, we can understand Customizer and compare it with Live Addons.

\section{Creating Live System Addons}
\label{sec:live}


\subsection{The Boot Process}
\label{sec:boot}
Live systems such as Ubuntu 16.10 amd64, use casper scripts for booting.
This describes the boot process in shortened form:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The kernel is loaded.
        It loads the file \texttt{casper/initrd.lz}.
        This is a compressed minimal Linux file structure with shell scripts.
  \item The \texttt{init} script is executed.
        It passes the boot parameters further to the \texttt{casper} script.
  \item The \texttt{casper} script looks for all mountable files with a \texttt{.ext2}, \texttt{.squashfs} and folders with a \texttt{.dir} extension in the \texttt{casper} folder.
        These are mounted in order of the extension and the name.
  \item These mounted folders are used as a basis for Another Union File (AUFS) in read-only mode.
        When a program wants to open a file in AUFS, the file is looked for in the given order in the mounted file systems.
        The first occurrence is used.
  \item In case persistence is enables, see Section~\ref{sec:pers}, the \texttt{casper-rw} file is included in the AUFS mount as first writable file system.
  \item A script changes the root of the file system into the AUFS folder.
        Then, \texttt{/sbin/init} is executed and the system boots.
\end{enumerate}

The live system is stored in the \texttt{filesystem.squashfs} file.
As we can see, the boot process does handle a set of these files simultaneously.
Thus, we if we create another \texttt{.squashfs} file, it is mounted and the files are accessible when the user logs in.

\section{Implementation}

Adding a program or files to the live image before boot can be done with a simple copy and paste of a file system file or directory into the \texttt{casper} folder.
Section~\ref{sec:boot} talks about how the file is integrated into the live system.

In order to create such files, we created a command line tool named ``Live Addon Maker".
